Foursquare Notifier

Foursquare Notifier (fs-notify) was created by Kirk Bateman <kirk.bateman@gmail.com>, basically because I wanted to knock something together and I really quite like foursquare.

Just a quickly knocked together python app for linux.

It uses the foursquare api to poll at a regular interval for any checkins from your friends. Then it displays any checkins, or shouts using the pynotify api.

Avatar images are cached in the cache/ folder to minimize traffic used to get images.

So requirements:
	Python
	pynotify
	foursquare
	pygtk (really only used for the poll timer)

You can find the python foursquare api at:
