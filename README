Foursquare Notifier

Just a quickly knocked together python app for linux.

It uses the foursquare api to poll at a regular interval for any checkins from your friends.
Then it displays any checkins, or shouts using the pynotify api.

Avatar images are cached in the cache/ folder to minimize traffic used to get images.

So requirements:
	Python
	pynotify
	foursquare
	pygtk (really only used for the poll timer)
